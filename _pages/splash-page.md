    title: "Financial modeling of combustion turbine power plants operating in US power markets"
    excerpt: "Investment in electricity generation infrastructure if often thought to be as long lived and risky. Which is true in some cases. However our hypothesis is that unlike other generation infrastructure, investment in natural gas combustion turbine power plants is less risker and can be recovered sooner. To test our hypothesis we model the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operated by different RTOs to estimate the revenue generated by NGCT plant and the payback period and discuss its implications on capacity expansion planning of NGCT"
