<div class="content">
  <p><ul>
  <li>Analyzed policies related to Solar Photovoltaics (PV) in Germany, Japan, United States and China and developed a model for relationship between adoption of Solar PV and its Net Present Value to the customers by performing a non-linear regression analysis</li>
  <li>Proposed funding deployment of Solar PV as a policy measure to increase the adoption and reduce the future cost of carbon mitigation</li>

<div class="content">
  <p><ul>
  <li>Analyzed policies related to feed in tariff, net metering, tax credits, renewable energy credits, and subsidies for residential Solar Photovoltaics (PV) in Germany, Japan, United States and China and calculated the Net Present Value of investment in a solar PV system</li>
  <li>Performed a non-linear regression analysis to model and quantify the relationship between adoption and NPV and identified that it follows an error function implying high adoption for marginal increase in NPV </li>
  </ul></p>
